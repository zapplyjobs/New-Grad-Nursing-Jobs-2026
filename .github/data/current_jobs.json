The Nurse Manager must have the ability to lead and motivate professional and ancillary staff to develop their practice, knowledge and skill base, while coordinating with other members of the health care team to ensure quality patient care.\n\nWho We Are\nWe are a community built on care. Our caregivers and supporting staff extend compassion to those in need, helping to improve the health and well-being of those we serve, and provide comfort and healing. Your community is our community.\n\nOur Story\n\nWe started out as a small operation in California. In May 1969, we acquired four hospitals, some additional care facilities and real estate for the future development of hospitals. Over the years, we've grown tremendously in size, scope and capability, building a home in new markets over time, and curating those homes to provide a compassionate environment for those entrusting us with their care.\n\nWe have a rich history at Tenet. There are so many stories of compassionate care; so many \"firsts\" in terms of medical innovation; so many examples of enhancing healthcare delivery and shaping a business that is truly centered around patients and community need. Tenet and our predecessors have enabled us to touch many different elements of healthcare and make a difference in the lives of others.\n\nOur Impact Today\n\nToday, we are leading health system and services platform that continues to evolve in lockstep with community need. Tenet's operations include three businesses - our hospitals and physicians, USPI and Conifer Health Solutions.\n\nOur impact spreads far and deep with 65 hospitals and approximately 510 outpatient centers and additional sites of care. We are differentiated by our top notch medical specialists and service lines that are tailored within each community we serve. The work Conifer is doing will help provide the foundation for better health for clients across the country, through the delivery of healthcare-focused revenue cycle management and value-based care solutions.\n\nTogether as an enterprise, we work to save lives and can accept nothing less than excellence from ourselves in service of our patients and their families, every day.\n\nCareers at Tenet\nAt Tenet Healthcare, the heart of what we do centers on caring with compassion, which ultimately creates a bond between our caregivers and patients. Everyone contributes to these moments, whether providing care directly or supporting those who do.\n\nAs an organization, we provide employees with resources, tools and support to serve our patients and customers in the best way possible. We also take care of one another, helping team members further develop their career pathways and maximize their potential.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nEducation: Bachelors Degree\nExperience: 3-5 years\nLicense REGISTERED NURSE\nCertification BLS/CPR (AMERICAN HEART ASSN) ACLS & PALS WITHIN 90 DAYS\n\n#LI-MQ1\n\nTenet complies with federal, state, and/or local laws regarding mandatory vaccination of its workforce. If you are offered this position and must be vaccinated under any applicable law, you will be required to show proof of full vaccination or obtain an approval of a religious or medical exemption prior to your start date. If you receive an exemption from the vaccination requirement, you will be required to submit to regular testing in accordance with the law.\n\nBy applying, you consent to your information being transmitted to the Employer by SonicJobs.\nSee SonicJobs Terms & Conditions at https://www.sonicjobs.com/us/terms-conditions and Privacy Policy at https://www.sonicjobs.com/us/privacy-policy and SonicJobs Privacy Policy at https://www.sonicjobs.com/us/privacy-policy and Terms of Use at https://www.sonicjobs.com/us/terms-conditions\n\nSkills:\nHealthcare, Hospital, Leadership, Legal, Nursing Management, Operating Room Nursing, Outpatient Care, Patient Care, Real Estate, Registered Nurse (RN), Residential Construction, Revenue Management, Treatment Evaluation, Vaccination\n\nAbout the Company:\nSt. Mary's Medical Center",
