It doesn’t take a nurse to\n\nsee that the way travel nurses are treated sucks.\n\nNursing is already hard enough. Travel nursing takes serious guts. You get the toughest assignments\n\nin places you’ve never been. Which can be fun, but it’s also stressful. You’re\n\nin your element but outside of your hometown. You can be a stranger on the\n\nteam.\n\nIf anyone deserves someone in their corner, it’s\n\nyou.\n\nBut that’s not how most agencies operate. Which is why travel nurses hate working with them. We got into this\n\nbusiness because we saw bucket-loads of nurses moving through the \"churn\n\nand burn\" travel machinery. We absolutely hate that.\n\nYou'll do your best work when you have the placements you want and feel fully supported in\n\nyour work.\n\nWe pay our people well because we want them to\n\ntreat you well.\n\nOur recruiters are amazing (we picked each of them\n\nourselves), but if you've got a problem too big for them, they can come\n\nstraight to us.\n\nWe\n\nwork like ten feet away.\n\nThe \"Churners and Burners\" promise you\n\nthe same benefits. They might as well copy/paste them from each other. We have\n\nthem too:\n• 401k, holiday pay, healthcare, dental, travel\n• reimbursement, etc\n\nBut we've worked hard for you to enjoy some one-of-a-kind\n\nbenefits\n\nyou'll not likely find anywhere else, because they benefit you more than they\n\nbenefit us:\n• Our early pay program\n• Student loan reimbursement\n• Free well-being tele-visits with a psychologist\nBenefits\n• Weekly pay\n• Holiday Pay\n• Guaranteed Hours\n• 401k retirement plan\n• Wellness and fitness programs\n• Referral bonus\n• Medical benefits\n• Dental benefits\n• Vision benefits\n• School loan reimbursement",
