Our caregivers and supporting staff extend compassion to those in need, helping to improve the health and well-being of those we serve, and provide comfort and healing. Your community is our community.\n\nOur Story\n\nWe started out as a small operation in California. In May 1969, we acquired four hospitals, some additional care facilities and real estate for the future development of hospitals.

Tenet and our predecessors have enabled us to touch many different elements of healthcare and make a difference in the lives of others.\n\nOur Impact Today\n\nToday, we are leading health system and services platform that continues to evolve in lockstep with community need. Tenet's operations include three businesses - our hospitals and physicians, USPI and Conifer Health Solutions.\n\nOur impact spreads far and deep with 65 hospitals and approximately 510 outpatient centers and additional sites of care. We are differentiated by our top notch medical specialists and service lines that are tailored within each community we serve. The work Conifer is doing will help provide the foundation for better health for clients across the country, through the delivery of healthcare-focused revenue cycle management and value-based care solutions.\n\nTogether as an enterprise, we work to save lives and can accept nothing less than excellence from ourselves in service of our patients and their families, every day.\n\nCareers at Tenet\nAt Tenet Healthcare, the heart of what we do centers on caring with compassion, which ultimately creates a bond between our caregivers and patients. Everyone contributes to these moments, whether providing care directly or supporting those who do.\n\nAs an organization, we provide employees with resources, tools and support to serve our patients and customers in the best way possible. We also take care of one another, helping team members further develop their career pathways and maximize their potential.\n\nMINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\n\nEducation: Bachelors Degree\nExperience: 3-5 years\nLicense REGISTERED NURSE\nCertification BLS/CPR (AMERICAN HEART ASSN) ACLS & PALS WITHIN 90 DAYS\n\n#LI-MQ1\n\nTenet complies with federal, state, and/or local laws regarding mandatory vaccination of its workforce.
