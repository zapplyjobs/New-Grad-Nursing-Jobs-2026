They also: Apply leading-edge medical advances at world-class hospitals Utilize advanced technology, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), to reduce paperwork and focus on patient care Work at the best military nursing facilities on shore, at sea, and in the field RESPONSIBILITIES As an active duty Navy Nurse, you’ll provide high-quality nursing care, doing everything a typical nurse would do in a variety of settings: Military treatment facilities (in the U.S. and overseas) Austere environments (deployments, humanitarian aid missions) Onboard ships (aircraft carriers, hospital ships) Nursing in an austere environment could mean participating in humanitarian relief efforts, such as administering vaccinations in developing countries or providing emergency care to victims of natural disasters.

WORK ENVIRONMENT Active Duty Navy Nurses may serve at any one of more than 250 Navy and medical facilities around the world, from Hawaii to Japan, Germany to Guam, and Washington, D.C., to Washington state.

Additional opportunities exist stateside and abroad – aboard a surface ship, working closely with a nearby aircraft squadron, or even with the Fleet Marine Force. TRAINING & ADVANCEMENT Upon commissioning, Navy Nurses are required to attend Officer Development School (ODS) in Newport, RI. This five-week program provides a comprehensive introduction to the responsibilities of Navy Staff Corps Officers.

EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES High School Students Through a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) Nurse Option scholarship, the Navy can cover up to $180,000 of your nursing education at top colleges and universities. You can focus on your education with no military obligation until after your program is completed. Nursing Students With the Nurse Candidate Program (NCP), you can receive an initial grant of $10,000, plus a stipend of $1,000 per month for up to 24 months, helping you pay for nursing school. That’s up to $34,000 in assistance.
