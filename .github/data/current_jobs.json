At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science.

In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

In our previous cohorts, over 80% of fellows produced papers (more below).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We run multiple cohorts of Fellows each year.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s researchers use internal tooling and infrastructure to run the experiments that advance AI safety and capability. This role owns the researcher experience with that tooling — both the day-to-day support and the longer-term product vision. You&#39;ll be the person researchers come to when they need help, and the person driving improvements and automation to make that manual help unnecessary over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role sits on the Capacity Operations team at the intersection of research and infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Serve as a primary point of contact for researchers using internal compute infrastructure, including triaging access issues, resolving researcher requests, and real-time monitoring&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Proactively monitor usage patterns and work with researchers to optimize their workloads&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Help design the product roadmap for research inference tooling. You will gather user feedback, prioritize improvements, and drive execution&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prototype better tools: dashboards, automations, self-service workflows, and more intuitive interfaces for complex systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Build automations (using Claude) for common operational workflows&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have an engineering background (or equivalent technical depth) and have transitioned into or are drawn to product management, technical operations, or systems design work&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can query data, understand infrastructure, debug issues, and build tools and scripts to prototype solutions quickly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are a systems-thinker: when a researcher hits a confusing error, you don&#39;t just fix it, you ask why the system produced it and how to prevent it for everyone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Are comfortable navigating ambiguity across teams and context-switching between tactical support and strategic design&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Use Claude or other AI tools daily and are excited to teach others your best practices&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An understanding of compute infrastructure and familiarity with concepts like rate limiting, autoscaling, and request prioritization&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Background in ML infrastructure, ML engineering, or research engineering&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience with large-scale accelerator clusters (TPUs, GPUs, or similar)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Familiarity with ML training pipelines and how they consume inference capacity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Track record of building internal tools or developer platforms that people actually love using&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience in developer experience (DevEx) or platform engineering&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$270,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$290,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&#39;s ML Performance and Scaling team trains our production pretrained models, work that directly shapes the company&#39;s future and our mission to build safe, beneficial AI systems. As a Research Engineer on this team, you&#39;ll ensure our frontier models train reliably, efficiently, and at scale. This is demanding, high-impact work that requires both deep technical expertise and a genuine passion for the craft of large-scale ML systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role lives at the boundary between research and engineering. You&#39;ll work across our entire production training stack: performance optimization, hardware debugging, experimental design, and launch coordination. During launches, the team works in tight lockstep, responding to production issues that can&#39;t wait for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own critical aspects of our production pretraining pipeline, including model operations, performance optimization, observability, and reliability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Debug and resolve complex issues across the full stack—from hardware errors and networking to training dynamics and evaluation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and run experiments to improve training efficiency, reduce step time, increase uptime, and enhance model performance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Respond to on-call incidents during model launches, diagnosing problems quickly and coordinating solutions across teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain production logging, monitoring dashboards, and evaluation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add new capabilities to the training codebase, such as long context support or novel architectures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate closely with teammates across SF and London, as well as with Tokens, Architectures, and Systems teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the team&#39;s institutional knowledge by documenting systems, debugging approaches, and lessons learned&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You May Be a Good Fit If You:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have hands-on experience training large language models, or deep expertise with JAX, TPU, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work—you&#39;d describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are excited about being on-call for production systems, working long days during launches, and solving hard problems under pressure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive when working on whatever is most impactful, even if that changes day-to-day based on what the production model needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excel at debugging complex, ambiguous problems across multiple layers of the stack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively, especially when coordinating across time zones or during high-stress incidents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about the work itself and want to refine your craft as a research engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care about the societal impacts of AI and responsible scaling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Candidates May Also Have:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Previous experience training LLM’s or working extensively with JAX/TPU, PyTorch, or other ML frameworks at scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributed to open-source LLM frameworks (e.g., open_lm, llm-foundry, mesh-transformer-jax)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Published research on model training, scaling laws, or ML systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with production ML systems, observability tools, or evaluation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Background as a systems engineer, quant, or in other roles requiring both technical depth and operational excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes This Role Unique:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a typical research engineering role. The work is highly operational—you&#39;ll be deeply involved in keeping our production models training smoothly, which means being responsive to incidents, flexible about priorities, and comfortable with uncertainty. During launches, the team often works extended hours and may need to respond to issues on evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However, this operational intensity comes with extraordinary learning opportunities. You&#39;ll gain hands-on experience with some of the largest, most sophisticated training runs in the industry. You&#39;ll work alongside world-class researchers and engineers, and the institutional knowledge you build will compound in ways that can&#39;t be easily transferred. For people who thrive on this type of work, it&#39;s uniquely rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re building a close-knit team of people who genuinely care about doing excellent work together. If you&#39;re someone who wants to be part of training the models that will define the future of AI—and you&#39;re excited about the full reality of what that entails—we&#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location:&lt;/strong&gt;This role requires working in-office 5 days per week in San Francisco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline to apply:&lt;/strong&gt; None.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Frontier Red Team (FRT) is a small, focused technical research team within Anthropic&#39;s Policy organization. Our goal is to make the entire world safer in an era of advanced AI by understanding what these systems can do and building the defenses that matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2026, we&#39;re focused on researching and ensuring safety with self-improving, highly autonomous AI systems, especially ones related to cyberphysical capabilities. See our previous related work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/&quot;&gt;cyberdefense&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2025/project-fetch/&quot;&gt;robotics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2025/project-vend-2/&quot;&gt;Project Vend&lt;/a&gt;.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Support Operations Analyst, you will build the analytical and workforce planning foundation that enables Anthropic&#39;s support organization to scale intelligently. This role sits at the intersection of data analysis, capacity planning, and operational strategy—providing the insights leadership needs to make confident decisions about staffing, investment, and service levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll own forecasting and capacity planning across our support organization, including FTE teams, AI-powered support channels, and vendor/contractor partnerships. This means building models that predict volume based on product launches, model releases, and customer growth; analyzing the relationship between support metrics and business outcomes; and ensuring we have the right resources in the right places to meet our service commitments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a high-ambiguity role where you&#39;ll often be building from scratch. We&#39;re looking for someone who can create structure where none exists, ask the right questions to scope problems, and translate messy data into narratives that drive action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workforce Planning &amp;amp; Forecasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain staffing models that translate SLA targets into headcount requirements across FTE and vendor teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Forecast support volume by analyzing historical trends, product release calendars, model launches, and customer base growth projections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Factor AI support effectiveness (automation rates, deflection, Fin AI Agent performance) into capacity models to ensure accurate human staffing projections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with vendor managers to align contractor capacity with demand forecasts and service level requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model scenarios to inform strategic decisions about staffing investments, vendor mix, and coverage models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop frameworks for prioritizing automation initiatives based on volume impact and deflection potential&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytics &amp;amp; Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain and enhance dashboards that track productivity, response times, CSAT, queue health, and other key support metrics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investigate the relationship between support performance and business outcomes (e.g., how response time and satisfaction impact retention and churn)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Surface trends and insights that inform operational decisions—identifying what&#39;s driving volume, where bottlenecks emerge, and where investment is needed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Translate complex data into clear recommendations for leadership and cross-functional partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operational Partnership&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Support Ops, AI Support, and Human Support teams to ensure data and forecasts align with operational reality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Finance on headcount planning, budget alignment, and quarterly capacity reviews&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with Product and Engineering to anticipate how launches and feature changes will impact support demand&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to vendor performance management by establishing metrics frameworks and reporting cadences&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have 4+ years of experience in workforce management, support operations analytics, business analytics, or similar roles—ideally in a support or customer success context&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are deeply analytical with strong SQL skills and experience with data warehouses (e.g., BigQuery) and analysis tools like Hex, Looker, or similar&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have hands-on experience with forecasting and capacity planning, including modeling staffing needs against service level targets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable working with ambiguity—you can take a vague question, scope it into an answerable problem, and deliver insights that drive decisions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand support operations metrics (SLAs, handle time, CSAT, deflection rates) and can connect them to business impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience working with BPO or vendor partners on staffing, performance, and capacity alignment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly—you can translate technical analysis into narratives that resonate with both operational teams and executives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are curious about AI and excited to work in an environment where the product and support landscape evolve rapidly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-paced environments and can balance building foundational infrastructure with responding to urgent business questions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have experience with workforce management platforms (e.g., Assembled, NICE, Calabrio) is a plus, but not required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$131,040&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$165,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt;

They’re seeing the pivots, the shrinking req loads, and the ‘doing more with less’ memos that usually precede a layoff. If you’re currently at a startup that’s struggling to find its footing, or a business where the hiring bar has dropped just to fill seats, you know exactly how fragile that ‘growth’ story feels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsara is the exception.&lt;/strong&gt; We are a fortress in a volatile market. We are a &lt;strong&gt;$1.75B ARR, NYSE-listed powerhouse&lt;/strong&gt; that sells essential technology to the physical operations powering the global economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And we aren&#39;t just stable—we’re expanding. Our UK Mid-Market team grew &lt;strong&gt;70% year-over-year&lt;/strong&gt; last year, and we need the talent engine to match that velocity. We aren&#39;t looking for someone to manage inbounds; we’re looking for a recruiter who wants to move from a shaky seat into a high-conviction, high-growth environment where the fundamentals actually make sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100% Self-Sourced:&lt;/strong&gt; You own your destiny. There is no inbound safety net here. You will be expected to find, engage, and convert 100% of your own pipeline using best-in-class tools like HireEZ, Juicebox, and LinkedIn Recruiter.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The High Talent Bar:&lt;/strong&gt; We aren&#39;t looking for CV pushers. You will be expected to act as a rigorous gatekeeper, ensuring that only the top 1% of gritty, data-minded hunters make it into our process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Assessment: &lt;/strong&gt;You aren&#39;t checking vibes. You will be conducting deep-dive sales assessments, evaluating discovery mechanics, and ensuring every candidate has a structured methodology for success.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this role, you will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execute &amp;amp; Deliver:&lt;/strong&gt; Your first mission is to fuel the UK Mid-Market engine. You will deliver high-quality, targeted pipelines at pace across the UK, France, Germany, and the NetherLands.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Own the Data:&lt;/strong&gt; You are the CEO of your funnel. You will have total ownership of your response rates, passthrough rates, and talent market mapping. We make decisions based on data, not gut feel.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partner with Sales Heavyweights:&lt;/strong&gt; Work directly with GTM leaders to align on hiring strategies that move the needle. You are a consultant, not an order-taker.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master the Craft of Strategic Talent Acquisition: &lt;/strong&gt;We hire for execution but develop for mastery. You will be mentored by some of the most sophisticated talent leaders in SaaS, learning how to move beyond execution to becoming a strategic talent partner who can influence the trajectory of an entire region.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum requirements for this role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Agency Foundation:&lt;/strong&gt; You started your career in a fast-paced recruiting agency. You still have that hunter DNA and the resilience to handle a relentless quarterly pace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-House Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; 2–4 years of in-house SaaS sales recruiting experience within a high-talent bar GTM organisation. You&#39;ve proven you can translate agency grit into internal success.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EMEA Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve successfully closed reqs in the UK and at least one other European market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Acumen: &lt;/strong&gt;You can speak the language of sales. You know the difference between an order-taker and a territory owner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ideal Candidate is:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundational Mastery:&lt;/strong&gt; You recognize that this is a mid-level role where the goal is to bridge the gap between execution and influence. You aren&#39;t chasing a title change; you are here to build the bulletproof foundations of an exceptional recruiter—learning how to own a region, influence high-level stakeholders, and use data as a weapon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused &amp;amp; Structured:&lt;/strong&gt; You understand that structuring your inputs—sourcing volume, message personalization, and rigorous screening—is the only way to get consistent output.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-Minded:&lt;/strong&gt; You study your own conversion rates and market talent availability to stay ahead of hiring needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Process Iteration: &lt;/strong&gt;You possess a relentless drive for self-improvement. You iterate on your outreach and your screening questions based on what the data tells you.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in it for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build the Foundation for Leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; We believe leadership is a set of skills, not just a job title.

Startups move faster than ever—what used to take years now happens in days—and the decisions founders make early can either unlock scale or become long-term constraints. We partner with startups at the critical moments where technical, commercial, and strategic support starts to matter most.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re a talent-dense team made up of former founders, engineers, and experienced go-to-market operators who bring firsthand experience building, scaling, and supporting modern software companies. Many of us have sat on the other side of the table, making architectural decisions, navigating tradeoffs, and scaling under real constraints, and we bring that perspective into every customer interaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We operate with a growth mindset and strong shared ownership. We dig deep to understand our customers, work closely across functions as one team, and find ways to win even when the path forward isn’t obvious. Resilience, curiosity, and a willingness to push through hard problems are table stakes here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a team for people who want to operate with high trust, high agency, and high impact — alongside peers who care deeply about helping startups succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are an expert in Vercel, you have incredible pattern recognition, and are at the bleeding edge of the tech and tools defining how we live and work. In this role, you&#39;ll help startups unlock Vercel&#39;s full value from adoption through scaling—building relationships with founders and technical leaders who are making critical architectural decisions. You&#39;ll analyze usage patterns to identify expansion opportunities, coordinate cross-functional teams to drive outcomes, and guide teams as they adopt AI-native architectures. By leveraging automation and AI to maximize your impact, you&#39;ll help refine early plays into repeatable playbooks that scale across our startup portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Will Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full startup lifecycle: from landing net-new early-stage companies to expanding and deepening adoption as they scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build trusted relationships with founders, developers, and technical leaders by quickly developing deep understanding of their architecture, use cases, and technical constraints&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Landing new logos, driving early activation, and making Vercel the default choice before competitors get in&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Driving first activation, earning trust fast, and positioning Vercel as the obvious default stack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Use customer signals and usage patterns to determine the right next play and focus time on the highest-leverage opportunities for adoption, expansion, or re-engagement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Quarterback customers end-to-end, strategically deploying Sales Engineers, Developer Support Engineers, Product, and Support at the right moments to drive outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Own and grow a portfolio of startup customers by partnering with them as they move from early adoption to scale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Focus on pipeline generation, outbound, identifying high-potential startups early&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Partner with founders and developers as they adopt AI-native features and architectures, helping them understand how Vercel’s Frontend Cloud fits into a rapidly evolving developer ecosystem and supports new workloads, performance requirements, and scaling patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Use automation, agents, and self-built workflows to operate at high leverage and focus time and energy on the most impactful customer work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Operate comfortably in an evolving environment, helping refine early motions and turn what works into repeatable playbooks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for someone who sits at the intersection of technical curiosity, commercial excellence, and startup mindset.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks.

The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Together we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer you will concept, prototype, and build new experiences for our web presence. You’ll bring your creativity and expertise to the full range of the Stripe brand, across evergreen pages as well as time-based campaigns. You’ll both utilize and contribute to our libraries and design systems, and when appropriate work outside established systems to create new digital moments.&amp;nbsp; You’ll constantly have in-browser performance in mind, and create abstractions that other designers and engineers consume and build upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Design Engineers in WPP have a shared commitment to user experience and craft, but each pod has subtly different focus areas. The Collective pod leverages design, animation, and interaction to drive awareness, educate prospective users, and share Stripe’s expertise across public surfaces such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.com/&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The Expansion pod brings the same creativity and executional rigor to attracting new prospects and driving conversion, focusing on user journeys, interactive and highly polished tools for users, and building targeted experiences for our global users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Design Engineer on the Collective pod, you will help us continue to drive &lt;a href=&quot;http://stripe.com&quot;&gt;Stripe.com&lt;/a&gt; forward, bringing new experiences to life or refining existing content to inform prospective users about the company and its offerings. You will partner closely with designers, other engineers, and partners to execute and evolve the site, bringing technical craft and creativity to the expansive scope of Stripe’s web presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Collaborate with our team’s designers and partners to both create new experiences for and maintain Stripe.com&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work closely with other design engineers, pairing, mentoring, and continually building a culture of excellence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prototype and implement web animations and interaction-heavy product launch materials&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build beautiful, best-in-class end-user experiences to solve complex problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Utilize, maintain, and extend our design systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrate our web platform with self-serve authoring and experimentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We&#39;re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

Approximately two months prior to the start of your internship, we will match you with one of our four core operational pillars—Procurement, Global Operations, Supply Chain, or Fulfillment.

Your day-to-day will involve exposure to negotiations and vendor management.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; You may drive a project on logistics strategy or international expansion. Your day-to-day exposure will likely involve managing 3PL partnerships and freight operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain:&lt;/strong&gt; You may scope a project improving production management or inbound/reverse logistics.

You’re excited by the possibility of leading cross-functional workstreams and generating buy-in among senior leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Raw smarts: we are looking for people who can look at complex problems and solve them start to finish. Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Excel skills are a must; SQL / Tableau / Looker experience a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Process and operational thinking: you can tackle a problem independently and quickly iterate to a solution, and then also document it in a way that&#39;s easy to understand for all audiences. Previous Salesforce experience is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communication and stakeholder management: you&#39;ll need to be able to connect with sales reps and hardware engineers alike to figure out how we build the right processes and workflows to drive efficiency while also giving us the data to measure how we&#39;re doing. Strong written and verbal communication skills are a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexibility and hustle: you manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of professional experience with a passion for Supply Chain and Operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Verkada is committed to investing in the holistic health and wellbeing of all employees.

We knock out today&#39;s problems while also balancing our need to build for the long-term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ll be working in Salesforce and Google Sheets / Excel on a daily basis, while also talking frequently with our stakeholders in sales, marketing, ops, product, finance, and more to help troubleshoot systems issues, review insights from our analyses, and build future-state processes and systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Bring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High-impact self-starter: you take initiative to move projects forward and can operate well with little guidance. You’re excited by the possibility of leading cross-functional workstreams and generating buy-in among senior leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Raw smarts: we are looking for people who can look at complex problems and solve them start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills: you nerd out about data, can quickly structure analyses to answer key business questions to drive decision-making, and will also have perspectives on building the right data architecture. Excel skills are a must; SQL / Tableau / Looker experience a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Process and operational thinking: you can tackle a problem independently and quickly iterate to a solution, and then also document it in a way that&#39;s easy to understand for all audiences. Previous Salesforce experience is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communication and stakeholder management: you&#39;ll need to be able to connect with sales reps and hardware engineers alike to figure out how we build the right processes and workflows to drive efficiency while also giving us the data to measure how we&#39;re doing. Strong written and verbal communication skills are a must.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexibility and hustle: you manage change and ambiguity well, and have no problems juggling multiple priorities while executing in a fast-paced environment. You’re comfortable pivoting quickly and often.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of professional experience, ideally in consulting, banking, private equity, corporate strategy, or a startup. Bachelors or masters from a top school preferred.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Previous Sales, Sales Operations, or Strategy experience is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be willing and able to work onsite five days per week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Employee Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Verkada is committed to fostering a workplace environment that prioritizes the holistic health and wellbeing of our employees and their families by offering comprehensive wellness perks, benefits, and resources.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Coinbase, our mission is to&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/our-mission-strategy-and-culture-18a92a3bb0fa&quot;&gt; increase economic freedom around the world&lt;/a&gt;, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/culture-at-coinbase-f0e1c2a99aff&quot;&gt; culture&lt;/a&gt; like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804&quot;&gt; mission-focused approach&lt;/a&gt; to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perform QA reviews of EDD and screening cases based on the quality rubric, ensuring compliance with established guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide constructive feedback to agents based on QA findings to support performance improvement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assist in refining and updating the complaints review process, contributing feedback and suggestions for ongoing improvements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct root cause analysis (RCA) to identify trends and areas for process enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with cross-functional teams to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of complaints handling.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Independently balance and prioritize multiple tasks to ensure timely and accurate completion of QA reviews.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be receptive to feedback from all levels and foster a collaborative environment that encourages open communication and continuous improvement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure compliance with global regulatory guidelines (including Global AML Regulations)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to reporting and visualizations that highlight complaint trends and areas for process optimization.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support the troubleshooting and resolution of escalated and complex EDD and screening cases, ensuring alignment with company standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ Years hands-on experience in executing QA, Audit, or Compliance Testing programs across a diverse range of financial services/products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Experience in working across multiple AML systems and programs (e.g., experience in combinations of Complaints, KYC, AML, TMS, and sanctions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working knowledge of BSA/AML laws, regulations, and rules for financial services/products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track record of delivering work outcome to budget and meeting quality standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in assisting, developing, and producing metrics and reporting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong written/verbal communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Highly-motivated, analytical, organized, innovative, and adaptive&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Multi-tasking ability, team-oriented, and a self-starter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Proven ability to work collaboratively with global partners in other functional units&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exceptional work ethic and flexibility to work extended hours to meet deadlines, when necessary&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to work with limited direction from management when situations occur&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intermediate to advanced level in PowerPoint/Google Slides and Excel/Google Sheets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACAMS certification (nice to have)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience at crypto exchanges or in financial services, ideally in payments, trading operations or technical support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience in project management or analytics or quality assurance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced degree in business, finance or legal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced understanding of Google apps, JIRA and Salesforce Service Cloud&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P75250&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;#LI-Remote&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;fortidlp-input-element-parent&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Transparency Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; The target annual&lt;strong&gt; base&lt;/strong&gt; salary for this position can range as detailed below.

Startups move faster than ever—what used to take years now happens in days—and the decisions founders make early can either unlock scale or become long-term constraints. We partner with startups at the critical moments where technical, commercial, and strategic support starts to matter most.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re a talent-dense team made up of former founders, engineers, and experienced go-to-market operators who bring firsthand experience building, scaling, and supporting modern software companies.

You&#39;ll analyze usage patterns to identify expansion opportunities, coordinate cross-functional teams to drive outcomes, and guide teams as they adopt AI-native architectures.

Solid SQL is a must, and you should be cool with warehouse-backed apps. Bonus points if you've played around with LLM applications, including:\n                  - Getting tools/functions to work and making sure the outputs are structured and validated.\n                  - Retrieval patterns (like RAG), routing, and keeping track of context.\n                  - Prompt management, versioning, and figuring out how well they work (evaluation).\n- AI Ecosystem Familiarity (You Know Your AI Stuff): Some exposure to tools like LangGraph, Botpress, or other agent builders is great (building agents and packaging up tools). Understanding streaming systems (WebSockets/HTTP2), including dealing with things like backpressure and reconnects, is also a plus. Basic audio knowledge (FFmpeg basics, codecs) and familiarity with transcription services would be super helpful.\n\nWhat you'll gain:\n- Internship Certificate: Upon successful completion of the internship, you will receive an official internship certificate from GoHighLevel, validating your contribution and learnings.\n- Potential Full-Time Opportunity: Exceptional performers may be considered for a full-time role based on performance and business needs.\n- Real-World Experience: Hands-on experience with software development projects, and collaboration with various teams.\n- Mentorship & Development: Guidance from experienced colleagues &  developers  to accelerate your learning and professional growth.\n- Career Growth: Become a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in application development  with opportunities to take on increasing responsibility and ownership over time.\n- Domain knowledge: Good exposure to SaaS,  sales and marketing domain\n",

As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Sales Engineer at Samsara, you’d be an integral part of a diverse team working to help modernize essential industries through the application of cutting edge IoT solutions.&amp;nbsp; Your work would directly contribute to a cleaner, more efficient and productive supply chain by creating safer roadways, reducing fuel consumption and emissions, and providing a consolidated platform for connecting operations.&amp;nbsp; Our daily customer engagements include conversations around how IoT can positively impact logistics management, workplace safety programs, fleet maintenance strategies, global asset management, and regulatory compliance.&amp;nbsp; This means a successful SE at Samsara will develop a thorough understanding of the application of IoT hardware and sensors, hands-on hardware installation strategies, managing data collection over carrier networks, presenting a robust cloud infrastructure, and building third-party system integrations (via our open API) to ensure the best technical solution is presented to Samsara customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a remote position for someone who is physically located in the United States, and within the North East region (Must be in the Eastern Time-Zone.)

Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You build genuine relationships with your customers: &lt;/strong&gt;The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer.
