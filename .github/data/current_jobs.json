    "job_description": "ABOUT By the very nature of their duties, Navy Nurses quickly rise to the top of their profession. They provide care not only for military servicemembers and their families but also for people in need around the globe. Working with a team of talented colleagues united by a common mission, Navy Nurses have the opportunity to educate, lead, and shape policy within Navy Health Care. They also: Apply leading-edge medical advances at world-class hospitals Utilize advanced technology, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), to reduce paperwork and focus on patient care Work at the best military nursing facilities on shore, at sea, and in the field RESPONSIBILITIES As an active duty Navy Nurse, you’ll provide high-quality nursing care, doing everything a typical nurse would do in a variety of settings: Military treatment facilities (in the U.S. and overseas) Austere environments (deployments, humanitarian aid missions) Onboard ships (aircraft carriers, hospital ships) Nursing in an austere environment could mean participating in humanitarian relief efforts, such as administering vaccinations in developing countries or providing emergency care to victims of natural disasters. Navy Nurses collaborate with physicians, surgeons, cardiologists, and fellow nurses as colleagues and equals. Navy Nursing provides opportunities to develop leadership skills that set you apart. WORK ENVIRONMENT Active Duty Navy Nurses may serve at any one of more than 250 Navy and medical facilities around the world, from Hawaii to Japan, Germany to Guam, and Washington, D.C., to Washington state. As a Navy Nurse, you could work at one of the highly acclaimed National Naval Medical Centers in Bethesda, MD; Portsmouth, VA; and San Diego, CA. You might also provide medical support aboard one of two dedicated hospital ships: the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy. Additional opportunities exist stateside and abroad – aboard a surface ship, working closely with a nearby aircraft squadron, or even with the Fleet Marine Force. TRAINING & ADVANCEMENT Upon commissioning, Navy Nurses are required to attend Officer Development School (ODS) in Newport, RI. This five-week program provides a comprehensive introduction to the responsibilities of Navy Staff Corps Officers. It covers military structure, traditions, leadership development, and military etiquette. Promotion opportunities are regularly available but are competitive and based on performance. EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES High School Students Through a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) Nurse Option scholarship, the Navy can cover up to $180,000 of your nursing education at top colleges and universities. You can focus on your education with no military obligation until after your program is completed. Nursing Students With the Nurse Candidate Program (NCP), you can receive an initial grant of $10,000, plus a stipend of $1,000 per month for up to 24 months, helping you pay for nursing school. That’s up to $34,000 in assistance. QUALIFICATIONS & REQUIREMENTS To qualify for employment in the Navy Nurse Corps, you must: Be a U.S. citizen currently practicing in the U.S. Be a student or graduate in good standing of a U.S. nursing program accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) Be licensed to practice in a U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or a U.S. territory (new graduates from NROTC or NCP must obtain a license within one year of beginning Active Duty) Be willing to serve a minimum of three years of Active Duty Be between the ages of 18 and 41 Be in good physical condition and pass a full medical examination General qualifications may vary based on whether you intend to serve Active Duty or Reserve Duty, and whether you are currently serving, have served before, or have never served.5c143e31-5e48-4549-b638-05792d185386",
